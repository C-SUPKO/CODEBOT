# CODEBOT
CSIT FINAL PROJECT, CODEBOT Learn

CODEBOT is a GUI for the openai api which allows the user to do four main functionalities.
The Java and Python Troubleshooters are as simple as fixing non working statements provided by the user. 
The code chatbot allows the user to talk to the ai model about code related topics and new skills they can learn. 
The Learn mode is the most open ended. It allows the user to guide the model and helps learn how topics that seem far separated from coding can be relevent. 

The GUI is meant to imitate a rudimentary OS. It provides a clock and the weather so there is no need to navigate away if this were to be used as a tool in a school environment. 
All user inputs as well as their responses are stored in a file so they can be refered to later but more importanly,  they are used to train the model before each session.
